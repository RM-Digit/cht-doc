# Security

Chronic POS offers more transparency, and security to the merchants cashflow. By
switching over to a blockchain solution no transaction is immutable, so managers will
have complete transparency of exactly how much money is coming in and out of the
store. Merchants will benefit from not having to accept debit cards, if a cannabis
related retail store accepts debit/credit cards they are at inherent risk for fraud due to
FDIC regulations, Chronic POS offers a safer, more secure payment solution.
