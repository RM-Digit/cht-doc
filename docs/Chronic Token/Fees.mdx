# Fees

A 3% transaction fee is associated with each transaction.

```md
1% is redistributed to holders
```

```md
1% is locked into liquidity
```

```md
1% will be rolled up and burned on each transaction; the burns acts against the
inflation to to lower circulating supply, in turn increasing the value of the token
over time
```
