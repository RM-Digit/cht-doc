# Cannabis Community

The Cannabis community has largely been a decentralized space. While this
attribute sets the community apart, it creates challenges that deter the growth of
sustainability within the industry. Chronic Tokenâ€™s goal is to build infrastructures that
help address these challenges. And we believe that blockchain and decentralized
finance technology will play an important role in achieving this.
